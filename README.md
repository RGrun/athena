# ATHENA

### NOTE

This was the first real piece of software I ever tried to write. I know the code is very rough; I had virtually no idea what I was doing when I tried building this system, and it is not representative of my current coding abilities. 

I've learned a lot since I wrote this system, and I put it up here mostly as a reminder to myself of where I started and how far I've come.

### DESCRIPTION

Athena was going to be a web-based scheduling system for a surgical tray delivery company. The intention was that Athena would track the status and location of a delivery company's surgical trays as its drivers transported them to and from various hospitals. It included custom-built (albeit somewhat crude) calendar and user-login systems.

Athena is written in pure PHP, CSS and JavaScript. The only external library is jQuery.

The project was cancelled after about three months of work due to funding problems.
